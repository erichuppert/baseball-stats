MLB Stats
=========
This is a python tool for downloading game logs for MLB games and loading them to a SQL database. For an example of the data, check out this [xml file](http://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/year_2009/month_07/day_20/gid_2009_07_20_minmlb_oakmlb_1/inning/inning_all.xml) containing pitch-by-pitch data about [one of the most epic A's game ever](http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=290720111).

This is a project that I worked on a couple years ago. I recently picked it back up to see how I could improve it. The code was atrocious, but I am in the process of making it cleaner and more performant.
